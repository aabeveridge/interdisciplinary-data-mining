# Network Macroscopes: Data Mining Methodologies for Social Media and Digital Content
This repository contains the markdown files, R code, and bash scripts for [MassMine's](https://www.massmine.org/) companion book.

## Authors
Aaron Beveridge and Nicholas M. Van Horn

## Rendering the Book
Using the `bookdown` library, the book is rendered from the Rmd files by running `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` in the repository directory. This creates the html files contained in the `docs` folder by rendering all of the markdown files into separate chapters.

## To Do List
- Finish chapter overviews and outlines
- Draft intro/proposal
- Draft chapter 1
- Draft chapter 2
- Submit to publisher
