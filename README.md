## Abstract
This book is written as the companion text for the free, open source research software called MassMine. Rather than merely providing a "textbook" or "how-to" guide for MassMine, the many difficult methodological and ethical concerns involved in researching social media and digital content have motivated us to produce a more substantive companion monograph. Because MassMine's community of users come from a diverse range of research disciplines (humanities, psychology, social sciences, technical communication, and business), this text is written to address a broad interdisciplinary audience when confronting the methodological and ethical concerns for studying social media and digital content. To this end, we have written *Interdisciplinary Data Mining* with the three following goals in mind: (1) to establish best practices and ethical guidelines for researching social media and digital content, (2) to explore key methodological areas for developing research questions and establishing interdisciplinary studies, and (3) to provide pragmatic techniques and accessible methods for collecting, sharing, and exporting data. Drawing heavily on natural language processing, graph and game theory, diffusion of innovations, and exploratory statistics, we have written *Interdisciplinary Data Mining* to facilitate mixed-methods studies of social media activity and digital content. Indeed, this book argues that the best way to make sense of how emerging technologies like social media continue to influence culture, politics, businesses, social groups, and individuals is by reaching across these categories and their respective disciplines to increase the resolution through which we visualize their influence and effects. While it certainly takes more than one book (and more than one software) to accomplish such a task, the best practices and research methodologies outlined in this book provide a tangible common ground for for students, faculty, and non-academics who are interested in interdisciplinary data mining.
