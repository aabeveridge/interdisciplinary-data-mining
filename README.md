# Interdisciplinary Data Mining: Best Practices and Research Methodologies for Studying Social Media and Digital Content
This repository contains the markdown files, R code, and bash scripts for [MassMine's](https://www.massmine.org/) companion monograph: *Interdisciplinary Data Mining: Best Practices and Research Methodologies for Studying Social Media and Digital Content*.

## Authors
Aaron Beveridge and Nicholas M. Van Horn

## Rendering the Book
Using the `bookdown` library, the book is rendered from the Rmd files by running `bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")` in the repository directory. This creates the html files contained in the `docs` folder by rendering all of the markdown files into separate chapters.
