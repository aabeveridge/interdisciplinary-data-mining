Van Horn 2020-11-03 Introduction This book is written as the companion text for MassMine, a free and open source research software. As the co-creators of MassMine, we have decided it would be irresponsible to merely produce a “textbook” or “how-to guide” for MassMine, because there are many difficult methodological and ethical concerns involved in researching social media and digital content. Because MassMine’s community of users come from a diverse range of research disciplines (humanities, psychology, social sciences, technical communication, and business), this text is written to address a broad interdisciplinary audience when confronting the crucial methodological and ethical concerns. To this end, we have written Interdisciplinary Data Mining with the three following goals in mind: (1) to establish best practices and ethical guidelines for research, (2) to explore key methodological areas for developing research questions and establishing interdisciplinary studies, and (3) to provide pragmatic techniques and accessible methods for collecting, sharing, and exporting data. Drawing heavily on natural language processing, graph and game theory, diffusion of innovations, and exploratory statistics, we have written Interdisciplinary Data Mining to facilitate mixed-methods studies of social media activity and digital content. Indeed, this book argues that the best way to make sense of how evolving technologies like social media continue to influence culture, politics, businesses, social groups, and individuals is by reaching across these categories and their respective disciplines to increase the resolution through which we visualize the influence and effects of these technologies. While it certainly takes more than one book (and more than one software) to accomplish such a task, the best practices and research methodologies outlined in this book provide a tangible common ground–and starting point–for the students, faculty, and non-academics who are interested in becoming practitioners of interdisciplinary data mining. Because this book has been written in R markdown, all of the example data visualizations in the methodologies section (Section II) also serve as functioning code examples to support readers in conducting their own studies. Each chapter provides suggested readings and tutorials to assist researchers in reproducing similar data visualizations for their own projects, and all of the code examples are available through GitHub. Additionally, the introduction will address why we have organized the book the way we have, providing a rationale for our choices and providing alternative ways of exploring the content in the book.

This chapter explains the underlying rationale for MassMine: the use Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to collect data from digital networks. Building on a basic description of API scraping, as compared to web scraping and web crawling, Chapter 1 explains the benefits and limitations of API scraping for interdisciplinary research. Chapter 1 Outline: - What are APIs and why do they exist? - API scraping vs web scraping vs web crawling - Scraping best practices - Robots.txt - Page visit delays - Bandwidth limitations of APIs - Potential pitfalls/mishaps to avoid - Accidental DDOS - Unintended Doxing - Conclusion - How other chapters extend the concept of “Being a Good Citizen of the Internet” "],["research-ethics.html", "Chapter 2 Research Ethics 2.1 Overview 2.2 Privacy Rights 2.3 Intellectual Property 2.4 Open Access", " Chapter 2 Research Ethics 2.1 Overview 2.2 Privacy Rights 2.3 Intellectual Property 2.4 Open Access This chapter addresses the many ethical and ownership issues surrounding data mining activities as they relate to interdisciplinary research. Focusing on two primary areas–privacy rights and intellectual property–this chapter examines key areas related to data collection, anonimization, and ownership. Chapter 3 Outline: - Privacy rights–why they matter - Respond to this faulty logic: - “If you’re not doing anything wrong, then you shouldn’t have anything to hide.” - Standard practices: - robots.txt - the limitations of “anonymous” data - intellectual property law and web scraping "],["understanding-networks.html", "Chapter 3 Understanding Networks 3.1 Types 3.2 Histories 3.3 Lifecycles", " Chapter 3 Understanding Networks 3.1 Types 3.2 Histories 3.3 Lifecycles Chapter 2 Outline: - What are the types of Networks? - message boards and email groups - forums - RSS feeds - social networks - Why read the guidelines and terms of service? - What can be found here? - Data dictionaries - Bandwidth restrictions - Limitations on research approaches - Example: - Twitter restricting “benchmarking” of their services "],["mining-text.html", "Chapter 4 Mining Text", " Chapter 4 Mining Text Outline: - Text as Data - Brief History of NLP - Bag of Words vs. Word Embeddings - Scrubbing and Data Janitorial Work - Word Frequencies and N-Grams - Zips law - Word Correlations - Documents and Corpora - Emoji - Sentiment Analysis - Speech-to-Text: Analyzing Audio and Video - Unicode and foreign languages "],["exploring-data.html", "Chapter 5 Exploring Data 5.1 Case Studies 5.2 Surveys 5.3 Qualitative Coding", " Chapter 5 Exploring Data 5.1 Case Studies 5.2 Surveys 5.3 Qualitative Coding Chapter 4 Outline: - the importance of the open data movement for interdisciplinary data mining - replicating studies/methods - archiving - data loss - legal issues involved with sharing data collected from APIs - what are the current methods and what should researchers know?

This chapter starts with a very simple definition of a trend according to Diffusion of Innovations, explaining the S-shaped model of diffusion, and the “Justin Bieber” problem. It then complicates this definition with discussions of “contagion” effects, and the problem of defining trends within singular networks. Moving forward, it looks at the question of “trends” for game theory, explaining some fundamental issues related to information cascades, the unintended consequences of “datafication” (the ‘like’ button, for example), and then other issues–such as the common practice of ‘gaming’ social network algorithms. The goal for the chapter is to continue to complicate the idea of “trends,” and to have the concept evolve as we work our way through Diffusion of Innovations, and then game theory, and then finally into graphs and other issues. For graph theory we discuss strong and weak ties, triadic closure, and other known phenomenon resulting from agent based modeling. Additionally, we can bring in other ideas, like metcalfe’s law and the dunbar number to also provide competing perspectives on how we make sense of patters/trends in digital networks. 7.1 Innovations 7.2 Games 7.3 Graphs Chapter 7 Outline - What is a trend? - Diffusion of innovations terminologies - S-shaped curve of innovation - the “newness” problem - How “game theory” complicates any simple notions of “trends” and virality - weak/strong ties - triadic closure - others? - Graphs, agents, and blackboxes - Others? - metcalfe’s law - dunbar’s number "],["black-boxes.html", "Chapter 8 Black Boxes 8.1 Models 8.2 Algorithms 8.3 Network Systems", " Chapter 8 Black Boxes 8.1 Models 8.2 Algorithms 8.3 Network Systems "],["healthy-networks.html", "Chapter 9 Healthy Networks 9.1 Spam 9.2 Misinformation 9.3 Echo Chambers", " Chapter 9 Healthy Networks This chapter brings the book full circle. If we open with a conversation of best practices, then we finish with a chapter that focuses on healthy networks and the efforts to head toward them. In other words, if our goal as individual researchers is to proceed as good citizens of the internet who follow best practices in conducting our research according to ethical standards, then as a group, interdisciplinary researchers should also have a stake in the future of the internet. How do we study the health of networks? What do healthy networks look like? Maybe we cannot yet provide a clear ideal on what a healthy network looks like, or what it’s key features may be, But, we can certainly define many of the current pollutants that are making our networks full of garbage–contaminants–and begin to define the problem. 9.1 Spam 9.2 Misinformation 9.3 Echo Chambers "]]
