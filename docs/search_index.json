Van Horn 2020-11-04 Introduction This book is written as the companion text for MassMine, a free and open source research software. As the co-creators of MassMine, we have decided it would be irresponsible to merely produce a “textbook” or “how-to guide” for MassMine, because there are many difficult methodological and ethical concerns involved in researching social media and digital content. Because MassMine’s community of users come from a diverse range of research disciplines (humanities, psychology, social sciences, technical communication, and business), this text is written to address a broad interdisciplinary audience when confronting the crucial methodological and ethical concerns. To this end, we have written Network Macroscopes with the three following goals in mind: (1) to establish best practices and ethical guidelines for research, (2) to explore key methodological areas for developing research questions and establishing interdisciplinary studies, and (3) to provide pragmatic techniques and accessible methods for collecting, sharing, and exporting data. Drawing heavily on natural language processing, graph and game theory, diffusion of innovations, and exploratory statistics, we have written Network Macroscopes to facilitate mixed-methods studies of social media activity and digital content. Indeed, this book argues that the best way to make sense of how evolving technologies like social media continue to influence culture, politics, businesses, social groups, and individuals is by reaching across these categories and their respective disciplines to increase the resolution through which we visualize the influence and effects of these technologies. While it certainly takes more than one book (and more than one software) to accomplish such a task, the best practices and research methodologies outlined in this book provide a tangible common ground–and starting point–for the students, faculty, and non-academics who are interested in becoming practitioners of interdisciplinary data mining. Because this book has been written in R markdown, all of the example data visualizations in the methodologies section (Section II) also serve as functioning code examples to support readers in conducting their own studies. Each chapter provides suggested readings and tutorials to assist researchers in reproducing similar data visualizations for their own projects, and all of the code examples are available through GitHub. Additionally, the introduction will address why we have organized the book the way we have, providing a rationale for our choices and providing alternative ways of exploring the content in the book.

"],["defining-trends.html", "Chapter 4 Defining Trends 4.1 Innovations 4.2 Games 4.3 Graphs", " Chapter 4 Defining Trends This chapter tells the story of “trends” for digital networks. This chapter starts with a very simple definition of a trend according to Diffusion of Innovations, explaining the S-shaped model of diffusion, and the “Justin Bieber” problem. It then complicates this definition with discussions of “contagion” effects, and the problem of defining trends within singular networks. Moving forward, it looks at the question of “trends” for game theory, explaining some fundamental issues related to information cascades, the unintended consequences of “datafication” (the ‘like’ button, for example), and then other issues–such as the common practice of ‘gaming’ social network algorithms. The goal for the chapter is to continue to complicate the idea of “trends,” and to have the concept evolve as we work our way through Diffusion of Innovations, and then game theory, and then finally into graphs and other issues. For graph theory we discuss strong and weak ties, triadic closure, and other known phenomenon resulting from agent based modeling. Additionally, we can bring in other ideas, like metcalfe’s law and the dunbar number to also provide competing perspectives on how we make sense of patters/trends in digital networks. 4.1 Innovations 4.2 Games 4.3 Graphs Chapter 7 Outline - What is a trend? - Diffusion of innovations terminologies - S-shaped curve of innovation - the “newness” problem - How “game theory” complicates any simple notions of “trends” and virality - weak/strong ties - triadic closure - others? - Graphs, agents, and blackboxes - Others? - metcalfe’s law - dunbar’s number "],["network-confidence.html", "Chapter 5 Network Confidence 5.1 Spam 5.2 Misinformation 5.3 Echo Chambers", " Chapter 5 Network Confidence This chapter brings the book full circle. If we open with a conversation of best practices, then we finish with a chapter that focuses on healthy networks and the efforts to head toward them. In other words, if our goal as individual researchers is to proceed as good citizens of the internet who follow best practices in conducting our research according to ethical standards, then as a group, interdisciplinary researchers should also have a stake in the future of the internet. How do we study the health of networks? What do healthy networks look like? Maybe we cannot yet provide a clear ideal on what a healthy network looks like, or what it’s key features may be, But, we can certainly define many of the current pollutants that are making our networks full of garbage–contaminants–and begin to define the problem. 5.1 Spam 5.2 Misinformation 5.3 Echo Chambers "],["mixed-methods.html", "Chapter 6 Mixed Methods 6.1 Modeling 6.2 Case Studies 6.3 Surveys 6.4 Qualitative Coding", " Chapter 6 Mixed Methods This chapter explains the necessity of mixed methods, and demonstrates the many types of analyses that they facilitate. 6.1 Modeling 6.2 Case Studies 6.3 Surveys 6.4 Qualitative Coding "],["research-ethics.html", "Chapter 7 Research Ethics 7.1 Overview 7.2 Privacy Rights 7.3 Intellectual Property 7.4 Open Access", " Chapter 7 Research Ethics 7.1 Overview 7.2 Privacy Rights 7.3 Intellectual Property 7.4 Open Access This chapter addresses the many ethical and ownership issues surrounding data mining activities as they relate to interdisciplinary research.
