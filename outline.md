# *Interdisciplinary Data Mining: Best Practices and Research Methodologies for Analyzing Social Media and Digital Content*

## Authors: Aaron Beveridge and Nicholas M. Van Horn

## Introduction
The introduction extends the abstract (see: `README.md`) and explains how students, faculty, and non-academic researchers can get the most from *Interdisciplinary Data Mining*. Because this book has been written in R markdown, all of the example data visualizations in the methodologies section (Section II) also serve as functioning code examples to support readers in conducting their own studies. Each chapter provides suggested readings and tutorials to assist researchers in reproducing similar data visualizations for their own projects, and all of the code examples are available through GitHub. Additionally, the introduction will address why we have organized the book the way we have, providing a rationale for our choices and providing alternative ways of exploring the content in the book.

**Introduction Outline:**  
- Extend abstract
- What is data mining?
  - Data Science vs. Big Data
- Rationale for outline and approach to book
- How to get the most out of this book
- Why R?
- How to contribute to MassMine

## Section I: Best Practices
### Chapter 1: Being a Good Citizen of the Internet
<!-- The introduction provides an overview of MassMine's data sources and functionality, and this chapter focuses primarily on the issues involved in accessing data from Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
- APIs vs Web Scraping
  - Robots.txt
- Understanding potential pitfalls
  - DDOS
  - doxing -->

### Chapter 2: Developer (Researcher) Guidelines and Terms of Service
<!-- Chapter 2 provides a detailed overview of MassMine's sources (Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Wikipedia, Tumblr, Web Scraping), and demonstrates how
- What are the questions we likely cannot answer at this time?
  - Why? Blackboxes around systems and algorithms that manage many digital networks
- Why must we read developer terms of service as researchers?
  - Twitter not wanting their networks "benchmarked"
  - Bandwidth/access restrictions
  - Limitations on the ways that researchers can collaborate and share data -->
